The purpose of this python code (*txt_to_java.py*) is to collect physico-chemical data of an electric discharge in air, contained in a text file, and to translate them into a Java file, interpretable by COMSOL Multiphysics, a numerical simulation software used by Hubert Caquineau.

The physico-chemical data of the air discharge are made available as a text file (.txt), written by hand. 
This file includes two types of data :
- the chemical species present in the environment,
- all possible chemical reactions between these species.
